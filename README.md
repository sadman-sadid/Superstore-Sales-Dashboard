Power BI Superstore Sales Dashboard

Overview: I have created 4 different KPI's, 1 Slicers and 5 different charts and a Map to get a meaningful insight of the given data.

The 4 KPI's are about the:
i)Total Sales.
ii)Total Quantity.
iii)Total Profit.
iv)Average Delivery Days.

By using the slicers we can get Data according to different Regions.

Beside that there are 3 Bar Charts. One of them are indicating Sales by Category. One is showing us Sales by Sub-Category and the last one is showing us Sales by Shipping Mode.

There are 2 Donut Charts. One of them showing Sum of Sales by Segment and the other one is showing Sum of Sales by Payment Mode.

Lastly the Map between the two Donut Charts are indicating Sales and Profit by Different States.
